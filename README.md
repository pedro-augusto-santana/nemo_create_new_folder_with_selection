# Create folder with Selection for Nemo
## Usage
  Select all the items you want to move, then right click and select "Create Folder with Selection", and select a name for the folder you want to create. If you are not the owner of the directory where the selected items are there is a prompt for the root password input 
  
## Installation
  Download the zip file and move __new_folder_with_selection.nemo_action__, __askpass.sh__ and __new_folder_with_selection.sh__ to ~/.local/share/nemo/actions (for user install) or /usr/share/nemo/actions (for system install). Make sure to mark both .sh files as executable.
